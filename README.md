BOUNTINY tiny bounty players

BOUNTY when you earn booty solving nice problems, like replit bounty cycles

TINY smaller fractional bounties that add up to solve big bounty faster, maybe

GAMES fun racing other players to solve problems first, and best

LIVE when multiplayers playing same game in real time, alive

FAST like countdown clocks on deadlines in minutes or hours (not days)

RESULTS like comparing various solutions for a problem

WINS when winners win on best and fast solutions, while everyone learns

DISRUPTION when we can do things today that were impossible yesterday

BROOKS LAW said more programmers make more confusion, get less fast results

MUTINY on Brooks Law, when we coordinate multiplayers building software faster

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law

OK?

LET'S BREAK BROOK'S LAW or laugh|cry trying

PROBLEM big problem break into tiny little problems

SOLUTIONS solve little problems, or not, on quick deadlines
